# Predictive-Model-For-Life-Expectancy
I have incorporated machine learning and deep learning models together to find life expectancy in today's time
My work proposes an ensemble approach that incorporates the strengths of Feed Forward Neural Networks (FNNs) and other machine learning models to analyze and predict life expectancy. By combining FNNs with regression algorithms like Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting, and Decision Tree Regression, we aim to improve the accuracy and robustness of life expectancy predictions. The ensemble framework leverages FNNs' capability to model non-linear relationships and process static data efficiently, while also integrating the diverse perspectives and learning abilities of other machine learning models. Using a comprehensive life expectancy dataset from the World Health Organization, comprising income composition, demographic variables, and death rates, we employ feature selection methods like Correlation Feature Selection and Mutual Information Feature Selection to identify the most influential features impacting life expectancy. The results from this ensemble approach have the potential to offer valuable insights into the complex factors influencing life expectancy outcomes, contributing to informed decision-making and enhanced resource allocation in healthcare systems.
